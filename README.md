# Atom RSpec Package

----

**Warning: This package is alpha and probably buggy,** but we decided to share
our progress for those who are interested. Proceed at your own risk!

-----

Add ability to run RSpec and see the output without leaving Atom.

I am not sure yet why only the first keymap works (Ctrl+Alt+T for running all specs in a file), but you can always right click and choose to run only the spec on the current cursor line.
